#
# 1. Finding "good enough" sequences for each gene
#	1a. Query MGI for the genes wihtout models and their qualifying seuqnece IDs
#	1b. Download the sequences from NCBI into a fasta file.
# 2. Blatting those sequences against the mouse genome
# 3. Filtering the blat results. 
#	3a. Only sequences with a single match across the genome 
#	3b. Only matches meeting %length and %identity thresholds
# 4. Turning the blat match results into little models
#	4a. Merges the MGI data from 1a with the filtered blat results from 3b
#	4b. Creates models with the structure: gene -> match -> match_part
# 5. Writing the results to GFF3 file
